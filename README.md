# Handwriting Recognition and Stock Price Prediction

This repository contains two main projects:

1. **Handwriting Recognition**: A Jupyter Notebook for building and training a machine learning model to recognize handwritten digits.
2. **Stock Price Prediction**: A Jupyter Notebook for analyzing and predicting stock price trends based on historical data.

## Project 1: Handwriting Recognition

### Description

The `Handwriting .ipynb` file demonstrates how to use a machine learning model to classify handwritten digits. This project leverages popular datasets and machine learning libraries to achieve accurate predictions.

### Features

- Preprocessing handwritten digit images.
- Training a machine learning model.
- Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.0
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `tensorflow` (or similar ML libraries).

### How to Run

1. Open the `Handwriting .ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow the cells to load data, preprocess, train, and evaluate the model.
3. Review the performance metrics and visualization outputs.

## Project 2: Stock Price Prediction

### Description

The `stock_predcit.ipynb` file and the `stock_price.txt` dataset are used to analyze historical stock prices and predict future trends using time series analysis and machine learning techniques.

### Features

- Time series analysis of stock prices.
- Data visualization for trends and seasonality.
- Predicting future stock prices using a machine learning model.

### Dataset

- **File**: `stock_price.txt`
- **Description**: Contains historical stock prices in plain text format, with one price per line.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.0
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `statsmodels`, `tensorflow` (optional for advanced modeling).

### How to Run

1. Ensure the `stock_price.txt` file is in the same directory as `stock_predcit.ipynb`.
2. Open the `stock_predcit.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Follow the cells to:
   - Load and preprocess the data.
   - Visualize stock price trends.
   - Train and evaluate prediction models.
4. Review the prediction results and insights.

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for recognizing alphabets in handwriting recognition.
- Implement more advanced stock prediction models (e.g., LSTM, ARIMA).
- Create interactive dashboards for visualizing predictions.
